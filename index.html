        <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
        <div class="main">
            <P> Established in May 1999 by famous spiritual and religious scholar Maulana Bashir Ahmed Farooqui, Saylani
                Welfare International Trust was built on the fundamentals of breaking the cycle of poverty, alleviating
                the
                financial troubles of the poor, giving people a chance to live a dignified life and spreading
                happiness.<br>

                We are an organization that believes in lighting up the lives of underprivileged people across the
                world. We
                endeavor to provide the best quality services in areas including food, education, medical and social
                welfare
                free of cost to people living in the dark. With over 60 different sectors, we feed thousands of hungry
                people each day, hundreds more are given the hope of life through medical health care, many are educated
                to
                become leaders of tomorrow and several are given the opportunity to stand on their feet financially.<br>

                Today, we are proud to say that our physical presence extends throughout Pakistan with a vast network of
                125
                branches operating in major cities including Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Hyderabad and
                Faisalabad. Apart from Pakistan, we have overseas offices in the UK, USA and UAE as well. Our worldwide
                branches are operating under the guidance of a team of over 2,000 working professionals who help almost
                125,000 people on a daily basis.<br>

                We strongly believe that a little help goes a long way and our work would not be possible without the
                generous support of our valuable donors. Our local and international donors have graciously lent us a
                hand
                by supporting our causes and enabling us to serve the needs of people in need.
            </P>
